# Did Seton Hill University Adequately handle Covid-19 
For this project I built and Analyzed survey data.  To determine if Seton Hill University Adequately handled Covid-19 by adding the proper rules and regulations to ensure the saftey of it's students. 

In this repository I have added a couple steps that were taken to ensure the analysis was pure.
I have added both the Dirty data and the Final data set that I used for my analysis as well as the code used to recode the data to "Dummy variables"

I have also added the full final project as well as the powerpoint presentation I created to present my findings.
